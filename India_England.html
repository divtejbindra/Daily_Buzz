                <p class="pp" style="font-size:18px"><b>External glory awaits:</b> Test Championship final, and now
                    ranked No. 1 in the world,
                    India
                    have prevailed in a virtual semi-final of sorts and forced their way into a Lord's final (venue
                    subject to COVID-related changes). No matter, they know better than to take the Kiwis lightly. India
                    and New Zealand have ghosts to bury in England and it's set to be a poetic end to a two-year Test
                    championship that has endured organisational turbulence and a pandemic, but has seen some
                    breathtaking cricket, including Headingley 2019, Mount Maunganui 2020, Brisbane 2021 and so many
                    more. All of that culminates at Lord's, come June 18, 2021. It's been a pleasure, as I, Rishi Roy,
                    wrap up the coverage of this series alongside Ramakrishnan MS, Kumar Abhisekh Das, and Venky. Here's
                    to a script that tops Lord's 2019. Get cracking, God. Because after 2020, you owe us one. *Curtains
                    Down*,<br><br>
                    India, at last, at long last, have made it to the final of the World Test Championship, and will
                    face New Zealand in the final. Mind you though, the last time that happened in an ICC event in
                    England, India suffered agonising heartbreak over two days. Little did New Zealand know, that
                    India's grief would double up on them at Lord's four days on.<br><br>
                    <b>There we have it:</b> England had two options when this Test began - win the game and spoil
                    India's
                    party, lose/draw the game to spoil their arch-nemeses, Australia's party. And they've eventually
                    managed the latter - though not for lack of trying. There's been a lot of furore about the pitches
                    on offer, and the batting (particularly by the top-order) has been below par. However, given the
                    conditions, however extreme, India have come out the better side. Their spinners, in particular,
                    were head and shoulders above their English counterparts, which eventually made the
                    difference...<br><br>
                    Led by Siraj and Axar Patel, India pick up the Trophy and do a little lap of the stadium to
                    acknowledge the sparse crowd who have come in to support the home team. It does look like social
                    distancing has gone out of the window in the crowd, but it's certainly a historic moment in Indian
                    Test history, this time with the context of the World Test Championship final..<br><br>

                    <b>Virat Kohli | India captain:</b> The comeback in Chennai pleased me the most. The first game was
                    an
                    aberration and England outplayed us. The toss played a crucial role and the bowlers weren't in the
                    contest. We bowled and fielded with more intensity and so the comeback was very heartening. Our
                    bench strength is extremely strong and that's a good sign for Indian cricket. When the transition
                    happens, the standards won't fall and Rishabh and Washy's partnership showed exactly that in a
                    crucial juncture of the match. We had to pick up our body language after the first game in Chennai.
                    Every team in international cricket is a quality side and we need to work hard to beat them, even at
                    home. Rohit's batting was incredible. His 150 on that pitch was equivalent to 250 on a true wicket.
                    Keeping that intensity going is most important and is the hallmark of our team. Rohit's knock was
                    the defining moment in Chennai, and Ashwin has been our most bankable player over the years so they
                    have been our best players this series. Now we can accept that the WTC final, which was a
                    distraction in New Zealand in 2020, but now it's a reality.<br><br>
                    <b>Ravichandran Ashwin | Man of the Series (his 8th such award):</b> The fact that we qualified for
                    the WTC
                    final is very important. Beating Australia in Australia has to be the pinnacle, but with the context
                    - being in the WTC final is not a joke - this means a lot to us. WTC final is as good as WC final.
                    The intensity was low in the first Test in Chennai, despite the high in Australia. Every time there
                    was a challenging time in the series, someone put their hand up, so this series win was right up
                    there. The last four months have been quite a ride. I didn't think I'd make a hundred in Chennai, I
                    went with the flow because my form with the bat wasn't great. I didn't think I'd start in the XI in
                    Australia, but after all the injuries, especially to Jadeja, there was more responsibility on me and
                    I'm content with my performances in Australia and here. Being desperate is bad, being content is
                    bad, but it's important for me to be happy, and I've stayed on my feet, and worked out batsmen and
                    I'm happy it has worked out well for me. If you put a board on what Rishabh has gone through in the
                    last year, I am extremely happy to see him succeed. It's been a little unfair being compared to
                    legends, and the way he's come out of it and kept in this series has been excellent. Axar is someone
                    who came into replace Jaddu. He deserved all the praise and he was very accurate for someone playing
                    his first series.<br><br>
                    <b>Rishabh Pant | Man of the Match (101 off 118):</b> I think the drills have helped, and my
                    confidence has
                    helped, transferring it from my batting to my keeping. This was a very important innings, especially
                    with the team under pressure. We were in a tough situation at 146-6, and there's nothing better than
                    performing when the team needs you the most. If I get the chance to reverse-flick a fast bowler
                    again, I definitely would.
