                <br>
                <h5>THE ORIGIN</h5>
				<p class="pp">
				In India, the origin of music, indeed sound itself is traced back to the origin of the universe. 
				According to Hindu mythology, the first ever sound is the Naadbrahma (Brhma as Sound), which pervades the entire 
				universe. It is the purest sound in the universe and is believed to be unstruck. Another myth associates the origin 
				of sound (and dance) with the Tandava of Shiva and Onkar. It is said that sage Narada then introduced the art of music 
				to the earth from heaven. Like dance, origin of the music in India was in devotional songs and was restricted to religious 
				and ritualistic purposes and was mainly used in temples only. This then developed in association with folk music and other musical 
				forms of India and gradually derived its own musical characteristics.</p>
				<br>
				<h5>MUSIC IN ANCIENT INDIA</h5>
				<p class="pp">
				The history of music in India can be traced back to the Vedic times. The concept of Naadbrahma was prevalent in the Vedic ages. 
				All organised music traces its origins back to the Sam Veda which contains the earliest known form of organised music. The earliest 
				raga owes its origin to the Sam Ved. During the late Vedic Period, music prevailed in the form called Samgana, which was purely a 
				chanting of the verses in musical patterns. After that music changed its course a little bit. The epics were narrated in musical 
				tones called `Jatigan.` Between the second to the seventh century AD, a form of music called `Prabandh Sangeet`, written in  
				Sanskrit became very popular. This form gave rise to a simpler form called Dhruvapad, which used Hindi as the medium.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="pp">
				The first reference to music was made by Panini in 500 BC and the first reference to musical theory is found in 
				`Rikpratisakhya` in 400 BC. Bharata’s Natyashastra (4th century AD), contains several chapters on music, which was probably the 
				first clear written work on music that has divided music into octaves and twenty-two keys. The next important work on music is 
				`Dathilan` that also mentions the existence of twenty-two srutis per octave. According to ancient notion, only these twenty-two 
				srutis can be made by the human beings. Two other important works written during this period were `Brihaddesi` written by Matanga
				in 9th century AD, which attempts to define Raga and `Sangeeta Makaranda; written by Narada in 11th century AD, which enumerates 
				ninety-three Raagas and classifies them into masculine and feminine species.</p>

				<h6>Some prominent singers from ancient india</h6>
				<img src="images/tansen.jpg" align ="center"><br>
				<h6><b>Mian Tansen</b></h6>
				One of the nine jewels (navaratnas) at Mughal emperor Akbar’s court — Mian Tansen is considered to be a pioneer of Indian classical music.
				His ragas are an important part of Indian culture and many of them contain the prefix, “mian ki”. For example, “Mian ki Todi” or “Mian ki
				Malhar”. Here is Pt. Shivkumar Sharma’s rendition of the raga, “Mian ki Malhar”.<br>
				<img src="images/tagore.jpg" width=198px height=255px align ="center"><br>
				<h6><b>Rabindranath Tagore</b></h6>
				Amongst several other things, Tagore was also a celebrated musician. He has to his credit 2,230 compositions. He created his songs from 
				scratch — the tune, the lyrics, et al. Rabindrasangeet is almost a genre on its own and the diversity in his music is beyond remarkable.<br>
				<img src="images/ms.jpg" width=198px height=255px align ="center"><br>
				<h6><b>M.S. Subbulakshmi</b></h6>
				Subbulakshmi was a legend. She was only 13 when she gave her first performance at the Madras Music Academy and stunned the audience 
				present. She would go on to create ripples across seven seas. She was the first musician to be awarded the prestigious Bharat Ratna, India’s 
				highest civilian honour.<br>
				<img src="images/pandit.jpg" width=198px height=255px align ="center">
				<h6><b>Pandit Ravi Shankar</b></h6>
				His music cannot be penned down, for its impact has been so vast that it encompasses audiences across the world. Amongst his ardent admirers 
				and students were The Byrds and George Harrison of The Beatles. If one were to begin naming the awards he won during his lifetime, one would 
				not stop. From the Bharat Ratna to the Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire to three Grammy awards. He saw it all, 
				he won it all.<br><br><br>
				<h5>MUSIC IN MODERN INDIA</h5>
				<img src="images/music2.jpg">
				<p class="pp">
				With the advent of the British in India, the court arts underwent a decline. Since most of the nawabs and noblemen lost their wealth
				and did not have the rewards to lavish on performers, most of the musicians had to move over to other occupations. A few gharanas did
				however manage to survive and continued. However, on the whole, Indian music took a backseat and interest and resources to sustain this
				art started to fade. A parallel development that gradually started forming at this time was that newer forms of media were now emerging.
				Thus, with the advent of television, radio etc western influences started creeping into Indian music. There was the spread of popular
				or `pop` music and this trend increased with the spread of cinema. Classical music too started being exported out of the country in the
				60`s, and an experiment of combining western music with the Indian Classical form also took place. This gave rise to what is popularly
				referred to as fusion music.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="pp">
				In the 70`s and 80`s disco and pop music entered the Indian musical scene. The 90`s further popularised the
				pop trend among the Indian audiences. With the further spread of information technology and an increasingly global world, we see a host
				of musical forms existing in contemporary India—rock, Hip-hop, jazz etc. Apart from these western forms of music, traditional forms of
				Indian music, such as Khayal, Ghazal, Geet, Thumri, Qawwali etc. also find place in the contemporary music. Bhajans and Kirtans, which 
				form a separate stream of religious songs, are also quite widely sung across the country. During all this historical development of music
				in India, Folk Music continued to keep its existence side by side classical music.<p>
